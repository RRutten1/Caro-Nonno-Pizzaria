Classic Margherita Pizza:

Ingredients:

For the pizza dough:

1 pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
Cornmeal or flour for dusting
For the toppings:

1/2 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 cups fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or shredded
Fresh basil leaves
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and black pepper to taste
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (around 475-500°F or 245-260°C) and place a pizza stone in the oven if you have one.

Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.

Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour.

Spread the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.

Sprinkle the minced garlic over the sauce, then add the mozzarella cheese on top.

Season with salt and black pepper.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

Remove from the oven, drizzle with olive oil, and garnish with fresh basil leaves.

Slice and enjoy your classic Margherita pizza!
