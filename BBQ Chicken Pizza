Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 475-500°F (245-260°C) and place a pizza stone in the oven if you have one.

Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.

Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour.

Spread the barbecue sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.

Add the shredded chicken, red onion slices, and mozzarella cheese on top.
