Ingredients:

For the pizza dough:

1 pizza dough (homemade or store-bought) another change
Cornmeal or flour for dusting
For the cheese topping:

1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup fontina cheese, shredded
1/2 cup Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1-2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
Fresh basil leaves for garnish
Olive oil for drizzling
Salt and black pepper to taste
One pinch of paprika powder
Instructions:

Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's preheating.

Prepare the pizza dough:

If you're using store-bought pizza dough, follow the instructions on the packaging to prepare it.
If you're making your own dough, roll it out into a circular shape on a lightly floured or cornmeal-dusted surface to your desired thickness. Make sure it fits your pizza stone or baking sheet.
Prepare the cheese topping:

In a bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella and fontina cheeses.
Sprinkle the shredded Gorgonzola and grated Parmesan on top.
Add minced garlic if you like a bit of extra flavor.
Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Be mindful of the salt, as some of the cheeses are already salty.
Assemble the pizza:

Transfer the rolled-out pizza dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.
Sprinkle the cheese mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge for the crust.
Bake the pizza:

Carefully place the pizza in the preheated oven.
Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
Finish and serve:

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.
Drizzle olive oil over the top and garnish with fresh basil leaves.
Slice and enjoy!
